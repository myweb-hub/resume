  <h2> My name is Maria.</h2>
  <h3> This website has been entirely built and designed by me.</h3> 
  <br>
  <h3>I am currently a student at a private English school and am studying web design and coding in HTML and CSS by doing courses. I am planning on starting my career at a young age and getting as much skills as possible, to benefit me in my future. I am learning business studies and economics as well as three languages (French,English and Greek with knowledge of Russian and Ukrainian) at my school . In the past I have a little history on working with Python and coding games on Unity as well as participating in a Robotics competition of 2018 in Cyprus, Nicosia on STEM and maze solving.</h3>

  <h3> One of my greatest honors is being accepted to a robotics-camp for STEM-Girls at TUHH (the University of Technology) in Hamburg to learn about 3-D printing technologies and coding from a German leader in additive manufacturing technologies.</h3>
